### Abstract
#### Introduction
Asian Americans suffer high rates of smoking and tobacco-related deaths, varying by subgroup. Cigarette and alternative tobacco use amongst Asians specifically considering subgroup, sex, and nativity are infrequently reported.

#### Methods
Using National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 2006-2018 and the 2016-2018 alternative tobacco supplement (e-cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, pipes), we explored cigarette and tobacco use by subgroup (Asian Indian (n = 4373), Chinese (n = 4736), Filipino (n = 4912)) in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs (n = 275,025)), adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors.

#### Results
Among 289,046 adults aged 18 and over, 12% of Filipinos were current smokers, twice the prevalence in Asian Indians and Chinese (p<0.001). The male-female gender difference was five-fold for Chinese (10.3% versus 2.2%; p<0.001), eight-fold for Asian Indians (8.7% versus 1.1%; p<0.001), and two-fold for Filipinos (16.8% versus 9.0%). 16.3% of US-born and 10.3% of foreign-born Filipinos were current smokers. Odds of Chinese ever using e-cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and pipes were lower than NHWs (ORs 0.6, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.5).

#### Discussion
Filipinos had the highest current smoking rates of Asian subgroups. While more Asian men were current smokers, high current smoking among Filipinas is concerning. More US-born Filipinos were current smokers than foreign-born, despite rates typically decreasing for US-born Asians. Investigating cultural aspects contributing to less frequent use of tobacco products, such as alternative tobacco products among Chinese, may aid campaigns in curbing tobacco usage.
