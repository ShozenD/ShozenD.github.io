### Abstract
The recent prevalence of Asian American (AA) adults of disaggregated ethnic groups with mild to severe mental distress receiving professional mental health treatment is largely unknown. Using self-reports from 381,989 respondents in the 2006-2018 National Health Interview Survey, we found that AA ethnic subgroups (Asian Indians [n=4373], Chinese [n=4736], Filipino [n=4912]) had twice the reported severe mental distress (Kessler-6 >12) than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW [n=275,025]): Asian Indian: 2.1%, AOR = 0.51 [0.37, 0.69]. Chinese: 2.2%, AOR = 0.54 [0.42, 0.69], Filipino: 2.9%, AOR = 0.61 [0.49, 0.76], NHW 4.4%). AA ethnic subgroups were half as less likely to visit mental health professionals than non-Hispanic whites (NHW) with matched mental distress levels, after controlling for sociodemographic variables: Asian Indian: AOR = 0.46 [CI: 0.32-,0.66]. Chinese: 0.55 [CI: 0.41- 0.75]. Filipino: 0.56 [0.43, 0.73]). Respondents who were born in the U.S. (1.54 [1.39, 1.74] or college-educated (2.01 [1.83, 2.20]) were more likely to visit a mental health professional than those who were not. Respondents over 65 were less likely to visit a mental health professional than any other age group (0.31 [0.27, 0.35]). Overall, the lower prevalence of mental health service utilization for increasing mental distress among Asian Indian, Chinese, and Filipino American individuals (in comparison to NHWs) may indicate a need for culturally specific mental health education and outreach efforts.
